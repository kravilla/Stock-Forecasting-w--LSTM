# Stock-Forecasting-w--LSTM

This project is an exploration in Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models applied to forecasting stock prices using Yahoo.com's data on the Intel Corporation (INTC)
stock price from 1980 until 2023. Other stocks can also be swapped into the model, although it should be noted that the LSTM model does not excel in 
extrapolating values outside it's training data.
